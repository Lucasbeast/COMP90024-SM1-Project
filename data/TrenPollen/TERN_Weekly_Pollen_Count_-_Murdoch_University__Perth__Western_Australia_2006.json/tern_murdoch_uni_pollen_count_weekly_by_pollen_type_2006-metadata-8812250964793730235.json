The data was collected for the period between September 2006 to December 2006 as part of a study of atmospheric particles and human health. This forms part of a study of the Australian Aerobiology working group (Haberle, Bowman, Newnham, Johnston, Beggs, Buters, Campbell, Erbas, Godwin, Green, Heute, Jaggard, Medek, Murray, Newbiggin, Thibaudon, Vicendese, Williamson, Davies ???The macroecology of airborne pollen in Australian and New Zealand urban areas??? ).<br/><br/>\n\nAirborne pollen counts were derived from deployment of a Burkhardt volumetric pollen and spore trap located on a rooftop at 15m above the ground. The sampler used a range of adhesive surface compounds on glass slides. The glass slides were stained with fuchsine. Analysis of each 24-hr period is conducted by counting three transects at 400 magnification. The data are summed to provide an average weekly pollen count.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"http://aceas.tern.org.au/knb/metacat/aceasdata.27/html\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) Data Portal</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>SUDO has spatially enabled the original data, acquired via the ACEAS Data Portal with permission from TERN.</li>\n<li>This dataset allows you to filter the data by the date of collection.</li>\n</ul>\n\n","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"ogc_fid","type":"Integer","title":"Unique Identifier","description":"Unique Identifier.","isDimension":false},{"name":"asteraceae_pollen_week_count_grains_metre_cubed","type":"Double","title":"Asteraceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3)","description":"Asteraceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3).","isDimension":false},{"name":"cupressaceae_pollen_week_count_grains_metre_cubed","type":"Double","title":"Cupressaceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3)","description":"Cupressaceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3).","isDimension":false},{"name":"east","type":"Double","title":"Easting Coordinate (WGS 84)","description":"Easting Coordinate (WGS 84).","isDimension":false},{"name":"first_date_of_week","type":"Date","title":"First Date of the Week","description":"First Date of the Week.","stype":"ordinal","categories":[{"key":"2006-08-28 00:00:00","label":"2006-08-28 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-09-04 00:00:00","label":"2006-09-04 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-09-11 00:00:00","label":"2006-09-11 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-09-18 00:00:00","label":"2006-09-18 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-09-25 00:00:00","label":"2006-09-25 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-10-02 00:00:00","label":"2006-10-02 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-10-09 00:00:00","label":"2006-10-09 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-10-16 00:00:00","label":"2006-10-16 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-10-23 00:00:00","label":"2006-10-23 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-10-30 00:00:00","label":"2006-10-30 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-11-06 00:00:00","label":"2006-11-06 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-11-13 00:00:00","label":"2006-11-13 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-11-20 00:00:00","label":"2006-11-20 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-11-27 00:00:00","label":"2006-11-27 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-12-04 00:00:00","label":"2006-12-04 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-12-11 00:00:00","label":"2006-12-11 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-12-18 00:00:00","label":"2006-12-18 00:00:00"},{"key":"2006-12-25 00:00:00","label":"2006-12-25 00:00:00"}],"filterValue":"Possible filter values","isDimension":false},{"name":"location","type":"String","title":"Location Name","description":"Location Name.","isDimension":false},{"name":"myrtaceae_pollen_week_count_grains_metre_cubed","type":"Double","title":"Myrtaceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3)","description":"Myrtaceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3).","isDimension":false},{"name":"north","type":"Double","title":"Northing Coordinate (WGS 84)","description":"Northing Coordinate (WGS 84).","isDimension":false},{"name":"num_days_data_collected","type":"Integer","title":"Number of Data Collection Days in the Week","description":"Number of Data Collection Days in the Week.","isDimension":false},{"name":"other_pollen_week_count_grains_metre_cubed","type":"Double","title":"Other (known and unknown) (Weekly sum: grains/m3)","description":"Other (known and unknown) (Weekly sum: grains/m3).","isDimension":false},{"name":"pinus_pollen_week_count_grains_metre_cubed","type":"Double","title":"Pinus (Weekly sum: grains/m3)","description":"Pinus (Weekly sum: grains/m3).","isDimension":false},{"name":"poaceae_pollen_week_count_grains_metre_cubed","type":"Double","title":"Poaceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3)","description":"Poaceae (Weekly sum: grains/m3).","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_pollen_week_count_grains_metre_cubed","type":"Double","title":"Total pollen (Weekly sum: grains/m3)","description":"Total pollen (Weekly sum: grains/m3).","isDimension":false},{"name":"week_number","type":"Integer","title":"Week Number","description":"Week Number.","isDimension":false},{"name":"wkb_geometry","type":"Geometry","title":"Geometry","description":"Geometry.","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","spatial":{"bbox":[96.816765696,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977]},"states":[]}}
