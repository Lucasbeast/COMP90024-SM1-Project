The data were collected between September 2009 and December 2011 as part of a research program looking at the relationship between airborne pollen and asthma exacerbations in children and adolescents (see Erbas et al. (2012) A case cross over design to examine the role of aeroallergens and respiratory viruses on childhood asthma requiring hospitalization; the MAPCAH study J. Biomet Biostat doi 21556180.s7-018). These data have been included as part of a study of the Australian Aerobiology working group (Haberle, Bowman, Newnham, Johnston, Beggs, Buters, Campbell, Erbas, Godwin, Green, Heute, Jaggard, Medek, Murray, Newbigin, Thibaudon, Vicendese, Williamson, Davies ???The macroecology of airborne pollen in Australian and New Zealand urban areas??? ).<br/><br/>\n\nThe September 2009-December 2011 pollen counts were performed using a Burkard 7-day recording volumetric trap (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK). Airborne pollen grains were trapped on an adhesive (Dow Corning Sylgard 527 silicone dielectric gel) coated tape or a glass microscope slide by intake of air at a flow of 10 l min-1. A microscope slide was used between October and December and transparent plastic MelinexTM tape was used at other times. The glass slide was changed daily and tape changed on a weekly basis and cut into seven pieces, each representing a 24 hr period. The pieces of tape were then individually mounted on glass microscope slides. Pollen grains were stained with Calberla's stain and counted using a light microscope by randomly scanning the length of the tape (lengthwise traverse). The different types of pollen on the slide were identified using in-house materials and the daily concentration of each pollen type expressed as the average number of pollen grains m-3 of air for the preceding 24 hr period.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"http://aceas.tern.org.au/knb/metacat/aceasdata.29/html\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Centre for Ecological
