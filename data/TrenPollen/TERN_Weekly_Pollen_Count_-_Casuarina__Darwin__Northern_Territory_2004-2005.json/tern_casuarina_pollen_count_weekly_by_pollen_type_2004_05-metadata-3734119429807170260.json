The data was collected for the period between March 2004 to November 2005 as part of a large research program looking at atmospheric particles and human health (see Stevenson, J, Haberle, SG, Johnston, FH, and Bowman, DMJS, 2007, Seasonal distribution of pollen in the atmosphere of Darwin, tropical Australia: Preliminary results, Grana 46, 34-42).<br/><br/>\n\nAirborne pollen counts were derived from deployment of a seven-day Hirst-type volumetric pollen and spore trap located on a rooftops at 14m above the ground. The Hirst-type sampler uses a range of adhesive surface compounds including vaseline and 10% paraffin wax in toluene on MelinexTM tape (Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, UK), silicon-based adhesive (Lanzoni s.r.l., Bologna, Italy). The seven-day tapes are then cut into 24-hr segments and mounted on glass slides with a stain such as fuchsine stained Gelvatol. Analysis of each 24-hr period is conducted by counting four transects at 400 magnification. The data is summed to provide an average weekly pollen count.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"http://aceas.tern.org.au/knb/metacat/aceasdata.37/html\"
