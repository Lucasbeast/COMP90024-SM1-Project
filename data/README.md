# Static Data Overview

This repository contains three sets of static data: `pollen`, `sensor`, and `twitter`.

## pollen

The `pollen` directory contains pollen data for four regions, sourced from the SUDO platform. The data is stored in JSON files, each named after the corresponding region:

- `campbelltown_nsw.json`
- `canberra_act.json`
- `parkville_vic.json`
- `rocklea_qld.json`

## sensor

The `sensor` directory contains long-term temperature and humidity records for a specific region, also sourced from the SUDO platform. The data is stored in a single JSON file:

- `meshed-sensor-type.json`

## twitter

The `twitter` directory contains a compressed file, `twitter.zip`, which includes the following two JSON files:

- `twitter.json`
- `twitter_word.json`

These files are extracted from a 120GB Twitter dataset used in the SPARTAN project, focusing on sentiment data and word analysis.


Each directory contains valuable data for different types of analysis, from environmental monitoring to social media sentiment analysis.
